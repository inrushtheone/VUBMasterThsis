    "### Single Linear Regression Model\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin with a single linear regression model where the number of citations serves as the dependent variable, and the topic loadings are the independent variables. This approach helps us understand how variations in the presence and strength of specific topics influence the number of citations an article receives.\n",
    "\n",

    "+\n",

    "- 𝛽1 is the coefficient for the independent variable 𝑋1, which represents the topic loadings.\n",
    "- 𝜖 is the error term.\n",
    "\n",
    "By fitting this model to our data, we aim to estimate the coefficients 𝛽0 and 𝛽1, which will provide insights into the strength and direction of the relationship between dominant topics and citation counts. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "To assess the goodness-of-fit of our model, we will use metrics such as the R-squared value. The R-squared value indicates how well our independent variable (topic loadings) explains the variability in the dependent variable (citation counts). A higher R-squared value implies a better fit of the model to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "This initial application of single linear regression sets the foundation for more complex models, such as multiple linear regression, which can incorporate multiple independent variables (various topic loadings) simultaneously. By progressively refining our models, we aim to enhance the accuracy and predictive power of our analysis, ultimately contributing to a deeper understanding of the factors driving citation counts in academic literature."

As such, we will furhter perfrom random foreast and deep learning technicals which could potentially take into account any non-linear relationships. Given the size of the avaiable data, they could be better alternatives. \n"
