    "The final section of this thesis seeks to explore the application of large language models (LLMs) in the domain of topic modeling. Given the inherent token limitations of LLMs, their direct application to extensive corpora for comprehensive topic extraction presents notable challenges (Devlin et al., 2018). These models are not ideally suited to process large datasets in a single iteration, which complicates their ability to distill and analyze the embedded topics within such datasets. Furthermore, LLMs typically do not have built-in quantitative evaluation metrics that can directly assess the quality and relevance of the topics generated, which poses additional hurdles for their use in systematic topic analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, LLMs hold significant potential in augmenting traditional topic modeling techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). Both LDA and NMF are capable of identifying topics represented by clusters of keywords and their corresponding weights (Blei et al., 2003; Lee & Seung, 1999). However, the interpretation of these topics often remains ambiguous and subject to individual interpretation, as the mere presentation of keywords and weights does not necessarily convey the nuanced context or thematic depth of the topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where LLMs can provide substantial value. By leveraging their advanced natural language processing capabilities, LLMs can be employed to interpret and summarize the topics identified by traditional methods (Raffel et al., 2019). Specifically, LLMs can analyze the clusters of keywords and their weights, synthesizing this information into a more coherent and contextually enriched summary. This process not only enhances the clarity of the topic representation but also provides a narrative that can be more readily understood and utilized by humans.\n",
    "\n",
    "Employing LLMs in this capacity could transform topic modeling from a largely quantitative exercise into a more qualitative and interpretative process. This integration could lead to more precise topic identification, better alignment with human cognitive processes, and potentially, more actionable insights for researchers and practitioners in various fields. Thus, while LLMs face certain limitations in direct application to large-scale topic modeling, their strength lies in their ability to refine and elucidate the outputs of traditional topic modeling techniques, thereby adding a layer of depth and usability that purely algorithmic approaches may lack."

       "'Neurons of primary sensory cortices are known to have specific responsiveness to elemental features. To express more complex sensory attributes that are embedded in objects or events, the brain must integrate them. This is referred to as feature binding and is reflected in correlated neuronal activity. We investigated how local intracortical circuitry modulates ongoing-spontaneous neuronal activity, which would have a great impact on the processing of subsequent combinatorial input, namely, on the correlating (binding) of relevant features. We simulated a functional, minimal neural network model of primary visual cortex, in which lateral excitatory connections were made in a diffusive manner between cell assemblies that function as orientation columns. A pair of bars oriented at specific angles, expressing a visual corner, was applied to the network. The local intracortical circuitry contributed not only to inducing correlated neuronal activation and thus to binding the paired features but also to making membrane potentials oscillate at firing-subthreshold during an ongoing-spontaneous time period. This led to accelerating the reaction speed of principal cells to the input. If the lateral excitatory connections were selectively (instead of \"diffusively\") made, hyperpolarization in ongoing membrane potential occurred and thus the reaction speed was decelerated. We suggest that the local intracortical circuitry with diffusive connections between cell assemblies might endow the network with an ongoing subthreshold neuronal state, by which it can send the information about combinations of elemental features rapidly to higher cortical stages for their full and precise analyses.'"

      "NMR quantum information processing studies rely on the reconstruction of the density matrix representing the so-called pseudo-pure states (PPS). An initially pure part of a PPS state undergoes unitary and non-unitary (relaxation) transformations during a computation process, causing a \"loss of purity\" until the equilibrium is reached. Besides, upon relaxation, the nuclear polarization varies in time, a fact which must be taken into account when comparing density matrices at different instants. Attempting to use time-fixed normalization procedures when relaxation is present, leads to various anomalies on matrices populations. On this paper we propose a method which takes into account the time-dependence of the normalization factor. From a generic form for the deviation density matrix an expression for the relaxing initial pure state is deduced. The method is exemplified with an experiment of relaxation of the concurrence of a pseudo-entangled state, which exhibits the phenomenon of sudden death, and the relaxation of the Wigner function of a pseudo-cat state.\n",

      "For orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) communication systems, the orthogonality among subcarriers is lost in mobile radio channels due to the frequency offsets caused by mobility. As a direct result, intercarrier interference (ICI) is observed on each and every subcarrier, leading to significant performance degradation. Many ICI cancellation methods such as windowing and frequency domain coding have been proposed in the literature to cancel ICI and improve the BER performance of OFDM in mobile channel. However, the performance improvement achieved by all the existing ICI cancellation methods is far from enough: the BER performance after ICI cancellation is still much worse than the BER performance of original OFDM without ICI. Moreover, popular ICI cancellation methods like ICI self-cancellation reduce ICI at the price of lowering the transmission rate and reducing the bandwidth efficiency. Other frequency-domain coding methods do not reduce the data rate, but produce less reduction in ICI as well. In this paper, we propose a novel ICI cancellation scheme which can eliminate the ICI entirely and offer a OFDM mobile system with the same BER performance of a OFDM system without ICI. More importantly, the proposed ICI cancellation scheme, namely Total ICI cancellation, does not lower the transmission rate or reduce the bandwidth efficiency. Specifically, the total ICI cancellation scheme takes advantage of the orthogonality of the ICI matrix and offers perfect ICI cancellation and significant BER improvement at linearly growing cost. Simulation results in AWGN channel and multi-path fading channel confirm the superb performance of the proposed total ICI cancellation scheme in the presence of frequency offset or time variations in the channel, outperforming all the existing ICI cancellation methods.\n",

      "Enterprise architecture advocates for model-based decision-making on enterprise-wide information system issues. In order to provide decision-making support, enterprise architecture models should not only be descriptive but also enable analysis. This paper presents a software tool, currently under development, for the evaluation of enterprise architecture models. In particular, the paper focuses on how to encode scientific theories so that they can be used for model-based analysis and reasoning under uncertainty. The tool architecture is described, and a case study shows how the tool supports the process of enterprise architecture analysis.\n",

      "The role of social networks has become increasingly relevant in recent years. This research focuses on analyzing the affect of social networks (SN) websites usage on students' behaviors and academic performances. This investigation included students gender based usage patterns of social networks websites with respect to our proposed websites scheme. We classified all students with similarity of social networks usage patterns for predicting their future behaviors, in addition we analyzed affect of SN usage on each groups of users academic performance based on their undertaken programs, semester and usage pattern including total time spent in SN websites during a day and the types of SN websites that visited by them, or identifying any changes in usage patterns of users during different days including final examination days or holidays if existed. Our investigation declared that, SN websites usage depends on students undertaken program(MTECH, BTECH,etc) is vary and also students of first year in BTECH program having more SN usage in comparison with others. This seems students in departments of Math and chemistry having less usage of internet specially SN websites and IT and CSE (Computer Science & Engineering) departments having more usage of internet and SN websites. Also our survey evident many differences among users of SN based on their gender groups. Our Analysis is based on proxy server log files of Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology, Allahabad, for the period of one year, including two final examination weeks and two test exam weeks' logs. Results of this paper in exploring groups of students with similarity of behavior can be useful to assist academic affairs and instructors to improve teaching, for web designers to evaluate and improve e-learning systems to improve curriculums or administrators to improve their policies and quality of services and many other benefits.\n",
